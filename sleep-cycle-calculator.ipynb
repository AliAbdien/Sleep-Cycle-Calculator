Each sleep cycle is approximately 90 minutes, and the user can specify the number of cycles they aim for (typically between 4 to 6 cycles).\n\n## Features\n\n- **Optimal Bedtime Calculation**: Based on the user's desired wake-up time and the number of sleep cycles, the script calculates the most suitable times to go to bed.\n- **Customizable Sleep Cycles**: Users can input their preferred number of sleep cycles.\n- **Healthy Sleep Tips**: The script provides general tips for a healthier sleep routine.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **User Input**: The script asks the user to input their desired wake-up time in a 24-hour format (HH:MM) and the number of sleep cycles they prefer.\n2. **Bedtime Suggestions**: Based on the input, the script calculates and suggests optimal bedtimes.\n3. **Sleep Tips**: After providing the suggested bedtimes, the script also prints out a list of healthy sleep tips.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use the script, simply run it and follow the prompts to input your wake-up time and desired number of sleep cycles. The script will then output the best times for you to go to bed and provide you with helpful tips for better sleep.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\ndef suggest_bedtimes(wake_up_time, num_cycles=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    Suggest optimal bedtimes based on wake-up time and number of sleep cycles.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    wake_up_time (datetime.time): Time at which the user wishes to wake up.\n    num_cycles (int): Number of 90-minute sleep cycles (default is 5 cycles).\n    \n    Returns:\n    list of datetime.time: Suggested bedtimes.\n    \"\"\"\n    wake_up_datetime = datetime.combine(datetime.today(), wake_up_time)\n    bedtimes = []\n\n    # Each sleep cycle is approximately 90 minutes\n    cycle_duration = timedelta(minutes=90)\n\n    for i in range(1, num_cycles + 1):\n        bedtime = wake_up_datetime - i * cycle_duration\n        bedtimes.append(bedtime.time())\n\n    return bedtimes\n\ndef print_sleep_tips():\n    \"\"\"\n    Print general tips for healthy sleep.\n    \"\"\"\n    tips = [\n        \"Stick to a sleep schedule, even on weekends.\",\n        \"Practice a relaxing bedtime ritual.\",\n        \"Exercise daily.\",\n        \"Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.\",\n        \"Sleep on a comfortable mattress and pillows.\",\n        \"Beware of hidden sleep stealers, like alcohol and caffeine.\"\n    ]\n    print(\"\\nTips for Healthy Sleep:\")\n    for tip in tips:\n        print(\"- \" + tip)\ndef input_time(prompt):\n    \"\"\"\n    Get user input for a time in 24-hour format (HH:MM).\n\n    Parameters:\n    prompt (str): The prompt to display to the user.\n\n    Returns:\n    datetime.time: The time entered by the user.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        time_str = input(prompt)\n        try:\n            return datetime.strptime(time_str, '%H:%M').time()\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid time format.
