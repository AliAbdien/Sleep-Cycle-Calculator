# Sleep Cycle Calculator

This Python script is designed to help users find the best bedtime based on their desired wake-up time and the number of sleep cycles they wish to complete. Each sleep cycle is approximately 90 minutes, and the user can specify the number of cycles they aim for (typically between 4 to 6 cycles).

## Features

- **Optimal Bedtime Calculation**: Based on the user's desired wake-up time and the number of sleep cycles, the script calculates the most suitable times to go to bed.
- **Customizable Sleep Cycles**: Users can input their preferred number of sleep cycles.
- **Healthy Sleep Tips**: The script provides general tips for a healthier sleep routine.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The script asks the user to input their desired wake-up time in a 24-hour format (HH:MM) and the number of sleep cycles they prefer.
2. **Bedtime Suggestions**: Based on the input, the script calculates and suggests optimal bedtimes.
3. **Sleep Tips**: After providing the suggested bedtimes, the script also prints out a list of healthy sleep tips.

## Usage

To use the script, simply run it and follow the prompts to input your wake-up time and desired number of sleep cycles. The script will then output the best times for you to go to bed and provide you with helpful tips for better sleep.
